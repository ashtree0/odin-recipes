      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Crispy chicken and rice is a dish made with tender, juicy chicken that is coated in a seasoned flour mixture and then pan-fried until golden brown and crispy. The chicken is then served on top of a bed of fluffy rice that has been cooked with fragrant herbs and spices such as saffron or turmeric, which give it a beautiful golden color and a delicious aroma.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp of kosher salt</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2/3 cup finely chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 gloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups uncooked long-grain rice</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 tbsp finely chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>1 medium lemon, cut in wedges</li>
      </ul>

      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sprinkle chicken thighs evenly with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>
        <li>Place chicken skin-side down in the Dutch oven; cook undisturbed until golden crisp and easily released from the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip chicken and cook for 3 minutes more. Transfer to a plate and set aside. Chicken will not be cooked through at this point.</li>
        <li>Add butter to the drippings and melt. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic; cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook, stirring to coat grains in drippings and lightly toast, about 1 minute. Stir in 3 cups stockand remaining salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Use a wooden spoon to scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the Dutch oven. Place the chicken thighs over the rice</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until all liquid has been absorbed and chicken is cooked through, 45 to 55 minutes. Add remaining stock if liquid is absorbed before rice and chicken are cooked through. Sprinkle with parsley and squeeze lemon juice over the top.</li>
      </ol>
