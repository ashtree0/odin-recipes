      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Unstuffed pepper skillet is a simple and tasty one-pan meal that features ground beef or turkey, bell peppers, and rice cooked together in a skillet with tomato sauce and seasonings. </p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>8 oz mini sweet peppers, sliced crosswise</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 lb lean ground sirloin (90/10)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 (15 oz) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons hot cherry pepper hoagie spread</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 (8.8 oz) package microwavable white rice</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Italian cheese blend</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh basil or flat-leaf parsley</li>
      </ul>

      <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add peppers and onion; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add beef and cook, stirring to crumble, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Season with garlic and Italian seasoning and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomato sauce, water, hoagie spread, and salt.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in rice until coated evenly with sauce. Cover, reduce heat to medium to maintain a simmer, and cook until rice and vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes, stirring once halfway through to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Uncover, remove from heat, and sprinkle with shredded cheese. Re-cover and let sit until cheese melts, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve hot sprinkled with basil or parsley.</li>
      </ol>
